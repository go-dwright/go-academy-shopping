# go-academy-shopping

Our goal is going to design and build ourselves a shopping api where customers can sign up to our service, list our products, and also place an order for products that we currently hold. 

There are three main objects that our requirements come under:

| Name      	| Comment                                                      	|
|-----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Customers 	| A person that can purchase a given product                   	|
| Products  	| A product that is available to be sold                       	|
| Orders    	| A record of a product that has been sold to a given customer 	|


A set of requirements has been split into multiple markdown files to fufil.
